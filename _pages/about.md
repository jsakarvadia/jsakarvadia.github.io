I'm a rising senior pursuing a B.S. in Economics and Computer Science, with a minor in Statistics.  

My academic journey has been shaped by diverse research experiences, including:  
- Improving hospital performance management via decision models grounded in causal inference  
- Machine learning enabled health estimation and degredation prediction for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles  
- Optimizing data movement on supercomputers for deep learning model training at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/)  

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in causal machine learning and am currently undertaking an independent study in which I am strengthening and expanding my foundation in causal inference, econometrics, statistics, and machine learning. More specifically, I am exploring machine learning-based methodologies for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This study is guided by select chapters from the recently released [CausalMLBook](https://causalml-book.org/).

Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. where I can integrate my interests in machine learning, econometrics, and causal inference to:  
- Develop advanced methodologies for understanding complex economic and social systems,  
- Improve decision-making through data-driven causal insights, and  
- Contribute to both the theoretical and applied advancements of causal AI/ML in policy, business, and science.
